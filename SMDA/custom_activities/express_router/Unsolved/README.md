There are three files in this project that need to be completed:

./server.js
./routes/apiRoutes.js
./routes/htmlRoutes.js

In server.js you must add the apiRoutes.js and htmlRoutes.js (already required at the top) to your express application.

In htmlRoutes.js you must write the code for the missing routes.

In apiRoutes.js you must create a new Router and write the code for the missing routes.
